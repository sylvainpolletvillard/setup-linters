# setup-linters

Auto setup linters for JS, CSS, HTML in a new project. My opiniated config, but can be easily changed.

Install and configure eslint, stylelint, htmllint and lint-staged to lint your changed files before a commit.

```bash
cd my-new-project
npx @sylvainpolletvillard/setup-linters
```
